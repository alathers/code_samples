As of 5/11/2015 this is 2 trivial modules


somehosttype is based on my very first puppet work in 2011/2012. I was porting legacy code from a previous toolset.  
  The idea was to duplicate and fragment a single massive toolset into 8-10 smaller functionally specific modules.
  The code has been refactored and in some cases fully deprecated and removed
  This represents what's remaining, in a highyl sanitized format
  Of particular not are short comings:
    -Very limited use of strict ordering
    -Very limited error management
    -Use of home brewed functionality; at time of initial authoring many extended features were not avaiable
    -Gruesome cross module dependancies



FullStyleAdoption is an attempt to do an "on the spot" migration of the legacy code into the puppet standard style format
  The module was spawned from scratch using  $ puppet module generate alathers-FullStyleAdoption
  From there I've replicated what I could, migrating home brewed functions to instead leverage functions from puppet standard lib
  I am unable to test this code in the infrastrcture I have as of first authoring, so I'm just doing as a course demo flow
  This includes a spot reading and implementation of the Augeas resource type
